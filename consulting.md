<p>
  I'm available for short-to-medium sized security consulting engagements involving application security, reverse engineering, source code review, and more.
  I believe in right-sized solutions and engagements based on client needs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm experienced with HIPPA- and PCI-compliant environments, all common (and uncommon) web vulnerabilities, including the OWASP Top 10, and much more.
