	<i>Homeless Heroes</i> is a game I (along with a fellow programmer) developed for the Something Awful Game Development Challenge (SAGDC). SAGDC is a one month long <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam">game jam</a>: developers are given a theme (that years: Subversive Edutainment), and are tasked with creating a game adhering to that theme within the allotted timeframe. All games submitted are then judged by a dedicated panel. The top 15 (based on the judges' votes) are then passed on to the community at large to vote on.
</p>
<p>
	The high level concept for the game is: you are a homeless man who has just gotten kicked out of your shelter. You then encounter another homeless man who informs you that this is part of an CIA coverup. Someone then interrupts, (Hyperspace Beth) and leads you on an exciting journey of uncovering an epic NSA conspiracy (Subversive) all while learning how to be homeless (Edutainment) with some funny twists throughout.

	<i>Homeless Heroes</i> has a definite <i>Deus Ex</i> feel, and this was intentional. <i>Deus Ex</i> is not only a spectacular open(-ish) world game, but it's plot also revolved around uncovering a major conspiracy. Another game we use for inspiration was Metal Gear Solid (MGS). In the MGS games, it's common knowledge that the main character, Snake, sneaks around using a box:

	Since homeless individuals often sleep in cardboard boxes, we combined these elements - a stealth based game where the player sneaks around in a box, but also needs the box to survive (heal and save games).
</p>
<p>
	The end result was a top 10 finish overall. <i>Homeless Heroes</i> finished number 12 in the judges results, and 7th in the public vote (for an average of 9.5).
