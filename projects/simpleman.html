<p>
	<i>Simpleman</i> was an attempt to build a back-to-the-basics platformer. The controls and gameplay are simple: use the left and right arrows to move, 'X' to jump, 'Z' to attack, and space to use any items that you retrieve. The game follows a simple, 4 level, linear difficulty path while following an implicit storyline that the player learns upon completion.
</p>
<p>
	 I wanted to the form of <i>Simpleman</i> to follow the function. So, the art is simple: big, geometric shapes with bold, bright colors, and pops of detail to really bring everything together. 
</p>
<p>
	The end result is a fun, super playable platform that anyone can enjoy.
