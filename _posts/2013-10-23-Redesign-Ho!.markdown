Out of no where, I've decided to redesign my site again; went with something a little more low key and usable this time.

I took it as an opportunity to learn/discover SASS, Bourbon, Neat, Jekyll, etc. to see what the fuss was all about. 
I'm pleasantly surprised; the addition of variables into CSS alone makes things vastly easier. Plus the ability to separate
CSS files more easily into workable chunks is just great.

Transitioning off of my custom Flask/GAE-backed blog framework and into Jekyll was the right move as well. 
It just makes more sense to leverage Jekyll + GitHub pages vs having to run my own pseudo-CMS with a separate code base.
