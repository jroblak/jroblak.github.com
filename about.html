<p>I have a <i>wild passion</i> for technology.</p>

<p>Ever since I discovered the magic of DOS on my first, childhood computer, I've been hooked.
I taught myself to code in my spare time and today I works as an Operations Manager at Mercatus 3,
an tech consulting firm. We provide our clients with rock solid front-, mid-, and backend solutions.
I spend my free time reverse engineering, working on web and app design/development, and writing
games.</p>
